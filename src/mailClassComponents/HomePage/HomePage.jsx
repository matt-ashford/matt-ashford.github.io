            . The reform law requires the Postal Service to develop its own
            public, interactive, service performance dashboard that, among other
            features, presents data in a manner that is searchable and can be
            downloaded in bulk by any person or entity, which is available at at
            https://about.usps.com/what/performance/service-performance/external-service-measurement.htm.
            The law tasks the Commission with:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              establishing requirements for publication of service performance
              information on the Postal Service's dashboard (in terms of
              organizational structure, geographic coverage, granularity, and
              temporal coverage);
            </li>
            <li>
              recommending any changes to the Postal Service's measurement
              systems that the Commission deems necessary for measurement and
              publication of service performance information on the dashboard;
              and
            </li>
            <li>
              regularly consulting with the Postal Service on appropriate
              features and information for the Postal Service's dashboard.
            </li>
          </ul>
          The Commission published the dashboard requirements and recommended
          changes to the Postal Service's measurement systems on February 9,
          2023 in Order No. 6439.

              The Postal Service sets service standards for products and product
              components, which identify the amount of time within which a
              customer can ordinarily expect a mailpiece to be delivered
              (expected days-to-delivery). The Postal Service also sets service
              performance targets for products and product components, which
              impose a goal for the percentage of measured mailpieces that
              should be delivered within their applicable service standard
              (on-time percent target). This dashboard provides a visual
              comparison of the actual percentage of measured Market Dominant
              mailpieces delivered on-time, which means within their applicable
              service standard (the service performance score), with the service
              performance targets established by USPS.
